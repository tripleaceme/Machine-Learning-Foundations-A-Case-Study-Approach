Q2. True or false: The model that best minimizes training error is the one that will perform best for the task of prediction on new data.
#answer:false


Q3. The following table illustrates the results of evaluating 4 models with different parameter choices on some data set. Which of the following models fits this data the best?

Model index	Parameters (intercept, slope)	Residual sum of squares (RSS)
1	(0,1.4)	20.51
2	(3.1,1.4)	15.23
3	(2.7, 1.9)	13.67
4	(0, 2.3)	18.99

solution:-rss is always small values i.e-13.67

Q4. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

linear_regression

solution:-f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with total linear regression line. so, w2 will be "zero"


Q5. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

linear_regression2.

solution:-
f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with total linear regression line and go through (0,0). so, "w0 and w2 will be zero".


Q6. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

linear_regression3

solution:-w0,w1 wrong
          w0,w2 wrong 
          w1,w2 wrong 
          w1    wrong
          w1 none  of above   wrong
          w2   wrong
          s0, try some differnt from them 
          
     answer:-     none of these is right answer 

Q7. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

linear_regression4.

solution:-f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with quandrtic curve and go through (0,0). "w0 will be zero".

Q8. Would you not expect to see this polot as a plot of training and test error curves?
solution:-
Error curve and model complexity.:--

1).trainig error contibue keep decreasing

2).test error goes down first and then keep up

so,the correct answer you could choose , both graph first decrease and then increase i.e-3rd option 

Q9. True or false: One always prefers to use a model with more features since it better captures the true underlying process.

solution:-
One always prefers to use a model with more features since it better captures the true underlying process is "false"
